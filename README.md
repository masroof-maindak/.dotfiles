### Init

To get started following a minimal Arch installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masroof-maindak/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

### Obsidian

Then, I'll want to get my Obsidian Vault. Set up syncthing to sync the `~/Documents/Vault` directory with my phone.

#### TODO:

- [ ] Test Bootstrap.sh
- [ ] Enable NetworkManager required?
- [ ] Better way to install GTK theme
